‚öõÔ∏è Chemistry Card Game
A fun and interactive Python-based Chemistry Card Game built with Tkinter, OpenCV, and Pillow, featuring real-time chemical compound validation via the PubChem API! Challenge your knowledge by combining elements to form real chemical compounds against the clock.

üß™ How to Play

Start a New Game:Click the "New Game" button. Four random element cards will appear.

Form a Compound: Using the displayed elements card, type a chemical formula into the input box (e.g., H2O, NaCl, CH4).

Check Your Formula: Click "Check Formula".

If it's a real and recognized compound by PubChem, you'll earn 10 points, and the compound will be added to your "Discovered Compounds" list.

If it's incorrect or not found, no points are awarded, and the cards remain the same.

Time Limit: You have 2 minutes to discover as many unique compounds as possible.

Game Over: The game ends when the timer runs out, displaying your final score and all discovered compounds.


‚ú® Features

Interactive GUI: A visually appealing and user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.

Element Cards: Dynamic display of element cards with full name tooltips on hover.

Real-time Validation: Integrates with the PubChem API to check if your entered chemical formulas are valid, known compounds.
